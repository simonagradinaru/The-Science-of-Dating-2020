<div id="hello-there" class="section level5">
<h5>Hello there!</h5>
<p>A warm welcome to everyone who’s passionate about science or simply curious about… dating! I am thrilled to have you around and I’ll do my best on keeping you reading further. Warning! There’s more to come!</p>
<p>If you’re intrigued about who’s behind the scenes, let me introduce myself. I’m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simona-gradinaru/">Simona Gradinaru</a>, currently a PhD Candidate in Social Sciences at <a href="https://www.ase.ro">ASE</a> and a full-time Data Scientist at <a href="https://today.yougov.com">YouGov</a>, living in Bucharest, Romania. I started this project as a challenge to learn and get experience with <code>ggplot2</code>, <code>markdown</code> and <code>blogdown</code> and also as an opportunity to wrap up my skills into a catchy analysis worth spreading with everyone. And sincerely, I couldn’t come up with a catchier idea then “The Science of Dating”!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy what you’re discovering here. If you have any data supported insights, I’ll be delighted to hear them at <a href="mailto:simonaegradinaru@gmail.com?subject=TheScienceofDating">simonaegradinaru@gmail.com</a>.</p>
